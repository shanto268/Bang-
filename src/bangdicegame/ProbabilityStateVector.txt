The probability state vector is as follows:
    
    [ P(Sheriff), P(Renegade), P(Outlaw), P(deputy)]

For a game with 5 players:
    [1/5, 1/5, 2/5, 1/5]

After Sheriff is revealed:
    Sheriff: [1, 0, 0, 0]
    All others: [0, 1/4, 2/4, 1/4]

Guessed role:
    maximum element of state vector.

The update process:
    After each turn:
        if helped sheriff (everyone is alive)
            [P(S), P(O)-skepticProbability, P(R)+skepticProbability, P(D)+skepticProbability]
        if shot sheriff
            [P(S), P(O)+skepticProbability, P(R)-skepticProbability, P(D)-skepticProbability,]
        if someone died, and role is revealed.
             the state vector is updated based on the new number of players.
        after someone (not sheriff) died
            a player who previously helped sheriff now starts shooting
        [P(S), P(O)-skepticProbability, P(R) + k*skepticProbability, P(D)-skepticProbability]

State vector always remains normalized.
